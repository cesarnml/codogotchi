# Promotion Queue

Candidate clauses for the upstream adversarial-review prompt
(`.son-of-anton/docs/template/delivery/adversarial-review-template.md`,
"diff-derived classes"). A class is promoted **only after it recurs ≥2–3×**
across phases or repos — every class added taxes every future review, so the
prompt absorbs only *proven-recurrent, review-reachable* gaps. Capture
(`ledger.jsonl`) is the staging area; promotion is a separate, rarer action.

## Candidates (not yet promoted)

### `compound-widget-cohesion-under-transform`
- **Seen:** 1× — `codogotchi-01` (attention bubble detaches from pet on drag).
- **Proposed clause:** *"For any draggable/resizable container, enumerate every
  child or attached overlay (bubbles, badges, affordances, pills) and assert each
  tracks the same transform. A multi-part visual whole must move atomically — the
  UI analogue of cross-file-atomicity."*
- **Caveat that blocks naive promotion:** only review-reachable when container
  and overlay live in the **same ticket diff**. In `codogotchi-01` they shipped
  in different phases (P4 pet, P6 bubble), so no per-ticket review saw both. The
  real lever may be a **phase-level integration review pass**, not a per-ticket
  prompt clause. Resolve this before promoting.
- **Status:** WAITING — needs ≥1 more occurrence to confirm the class and decide
  per-ticket-clause vs phase-integration-pass.

## Open meta-question (for the eventual `/soa quality-control` skill)

The 7 existing diff-derived classes are backend/CLI-shaped. codogotchi's
post-phase fixes are overwhelmingly UI/interaction/animation. Likely upstream
finding once evidence accumulates: UI-heavy SoA repos need a **parallel
UI-review class family** — gesture state-machine integrity, animation-frame
continuity, screen-space vs view-space coordinate bugs, compound-widget cohesion,
affordance hit-testing. Hold until the ledger has enough rows to name the cut.
